You can mail me, and contribute your list to [the Github of
Hackey](https://github.com/Marnix0810/HackeyBlock/). You could also make
me the owner of the list by directly mailing it to me.

My email for the Hackey lists is:
[marnix0810@vivaldi.net](mailto:marnix0810@vivaldi.net)

The adding of the optional lists is one of the new features coming with
version 3.15.\#\#\* of Hackey.

* * * * *

\*if there are enough optional lists submitted by that time, I am
counting on you. Please don't let me down!
