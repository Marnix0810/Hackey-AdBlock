# HackeyBlock Python Edition

Future plans of HackeyBlock have always been to be fully multiple-platform compatible, the first step to this goal is switching to a language that is supported on multiple platforms. To my and to more programmers, the solution is found in Python.

Python will be the language for HackeyBlock to switch to when enabling support for multiple operating systems(/platforms).

The code from the other projects will have to fade into Python, so help is always appreciated.
