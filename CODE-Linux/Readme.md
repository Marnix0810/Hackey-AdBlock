# HackeyBlock for Linux
Well, Linux support is part of my future-plans for HackeyBlock, but it will probably take some time before I actually can start with it. But supporting me by writing code will speed this up! I have not much experience on programming for Linux, so if anyone could give me some help, it is very pleased and it would speed-up the release of Linux versions.
