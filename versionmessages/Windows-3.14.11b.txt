Welcome to maybe the most stable version of HackeyBlock ever!

Update 2019-09-05:
I made a hard decision, but I am sadly announcing the following:

The Hackey PYE Project will not start, instead the original Windows version will just stop support, fading out.
The plans are to fully stop supporting HackeyBlock around end 2020. This may happen earlier or later.
 I am sorry to say this, but the HackeyBlock project seems to be too hard to maintain.
After the EOS (end of support) of HackeyBlock, other projects like FNew, Neveroffline and 
MuZikDL will have more time to be developed further.
The HARR project will continue, but will only be updated to fix error reports.
